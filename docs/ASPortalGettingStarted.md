The Messaging Gateway product section includes all necessary components to deploy and configure a remote network messaging gateway for use with the MobileAwareness product. Use of the Messaging Gateway is optional.

The MobileAwareness product section includes downloadable SDKs and documentation needed to use the MobileAwareness SDK in your mobile applications.

Also included is the online Configuration Generator, which produces a downloadable configuration file that is required to be bundled with any application utilizing the MobileAwareness SDK.

We recommend reviewing the MobileAwareness SDK Overview document to familiarize yourself with the features of the MobileAwareness SDK. Once you are ready to develop with the MobileAwareness SDK, you should download the appropriate platform SDK (Android, IOS, etc.) from the Downloads section, and consult the related Developer Guide listed in the Documentation section.

You will also need to use the Configuration Generator to produce a configuration file. The MobileAwareness SDK Developer Guides will describe the configuration details necessary for your platform, and the online Configuration Reference PDF will guide you in populating the Configuration Generator inputs.
